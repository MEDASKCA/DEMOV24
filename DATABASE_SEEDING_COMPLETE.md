## Seeding Scripts Created

### 1. `scripts/seedMasterDatabase.ts`
Seeds hospitals and shift patterns (foundational reference data).

**Run with:**
```bash
cd projectsocial && npx tsx scripts/seedMasterDatabase.ts
```

### 2. `scripts/seedConsumablesEquipment.ts`
Seeds initial consumables (sutures, drapes, prep, dressings).

**Run with:**
```bash
cd projectsocial && npx tsx scripts/seedConsumablesEquipment.ts
```

### 3. `scripts/seed1000StaffProfiles.ts`
Seeds 1,000 complete staff profiles with realistic London addresses.

**Run with:**
```bash
cd projectsocial && npx tsx scripts/seed1000StaffProfiles.ts
```

### 4. `scripts/seedExpandedConsumablesEquipment.ts`
Seeds expanded consumables and all equipment with NHS pricing.

**Run with:**
```bash
cd projectsocial && npx tsx scripts/seedExpandedConsumablesEquipment.ts
```

---

## All Data Includes NHS Pricing

Every consumable and equipment item includes:
- **nhsPrice**: NHS list price in GBP
- **packSize**: Number of units per pack (for consumables)
- **warranty**: Warranty period (for equipment)
- **supplier**: Official NHS supplier
- **productCode**: Manufacturer product code

This enables TOM AI to:
- Calculate procedure costs
- Track inventory value
- Generate purchase orders
- Compare supplier pricing
- Budget for theatres
- Forecast consumable usage

---

## Interconnected Data Architecture

All data is designed to be interconnected:

**Staff** → **Hospitals** (via hospitalId)
**Staff** → **Shift Patterns** (via shiftPreferences)
**Staff** → **Specialties** (competencies array)
**Consumables** → **Specialties** (specialty array)
**Equipment** → **Specialties** (specialty array)

Future procedure cards will link:
- Staff competencies → Required equipment → Required consumables → Applicable hospitals

This enables TOM AI to answer complex queries like:
- "Which staff can do a Total Hip Replacement at St Mary's tomorrow?"
- "What consumables do we need for 5 laparoscopic cholecystectomies?"
- "Which hospitals have Da Vinci Xi robots for robotic prostatectomies?"
- "What's the cost breakdown for a primary Total Knee Replacement?"

---

## Next Steps (Future Development)

1. **Tray Systems Database** (200+ complete sets)
   - Ortho: Hip Primary, Revision, Knee, Shoulder, Hand, Foot
   - Cardiac: Sternotomy, CABG, Valve
   - Neuro: Craniotomy, Spinal
   - General: Laparotomy, Lap Chole, Appendix
   - Each tray with complete instrument lists

2. **Surgical Procedures Database** (500+)
   - OPCS-4 codes
   - Average duration
   - Staff requirements by role
   - Equipment needed
   - Consumables lists
   - Estimated costs

3. **Procedure Cards** (linking everything together)
   - Link staff competencies to procedures
   - Link required equipment to procedures
   - Link required consumables to procedures
   - Link applicable hospitals to procedures

4. **Theatre Complexes per Hospital**
   - Equipment inventories for each theatre
   - Available specialties per hospital
   - Theatre capacity and bookings

5. **Update Roster Components**
   - Pull from Firebase instead of mock data
   - Real-time staff availability
   - Shift scheduling based on actual shift patterns

6. **TOM AI Integration**
   - Query Firebase for staff filtering
   - Answer questions about inventory
   - Calculate procedure costs
   - Suggest optimal staff assignments

```

**Firestore Security Rules:** Currently set to test mode (allow all reads/writes)

**Recommended for Production:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;  // Public read access

## Database Size Estimate

**Total Documents:** 1,227
**Average Document Size:** ~2KB
**Estimated Total Size:** ~2.5MB
**Firebase Free Tier:** 1GB storage (well within limits)

**Monthly Costs (estimated):**
- Storage: £0 (within free tier)
- Reads: ~10,000/day = 300K/month (within free tier of 50K/day)
- Writes: ~1,000/month (within free tier)

## Summary

All interconnected databases have been successfully created and seeded to Firebase. The TOM platform now has:

- 1,000 realistic staff profiles with London addresses
- 31 hospitals across London
- 14 shift patterns
- 140+ consumable types with NHS pricing
- 40+ equipment types with NHS pricing
- Complete interconnected data architecture ready for TOM AI

The database is production-ready for the NHSCEP demonstration, enabling TOM AI to answer complex queries about staff, procedures, equipment, consumables, costs, and availability.

All data is realistic, comprehensive, and properly interconnected to demonstrate the full power of the TOM platform.
